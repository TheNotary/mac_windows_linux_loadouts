## Windows Configurations (registries included)

- 01_dont_hide_stuff
  * Show file extensions
  * Show hidden files
- 02_fix_alt_tab_disable_peek
  * When alt tabbing, the open tasks will be covered up too fast for you to find what you need.  This solves that.
- 03_startup_programs

- Set Atom as default .txt editor?
